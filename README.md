# Introduction

This repo contains Highlander Racing's '23 firmware (in progress) along with relevant documentation and notes.

## Status

Currently, we are parsing through previous years' code and attempting to both implement it and redefine their modules for the '23 car. Existing targets are verifying hardware integrity of the VCU1200 and adapting sensor modules for this year's sensor array. We'll also require standard design practices of modularizing and abstracting code further, along with a relevant test suite.
